# Tip Calculator

This project, called **Tip Calculator**, was created as part of an interview process. It is built using React Native along with Expo and Tamagui.

## Overview

The Tip Calculator project is designed to:
- Display a list of transactions.
- Show the total tip amount received by each employee.
- Show the tip amount for each employee in an individual transaction.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: A framework for building native apps using React.
- **Expo**: A platform for making universal React applications.
- **Tamagui**: A UI kit for creating consistent and beautiful user interfaces in React Native.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Expo CLI**: Command line tool for developing Expo apps.
- **Git**: Version control system to clone the project repository.
